🧬 Welcome to Decoded by Zinia
Hi, I’m Zinia Mohanta — a molecular imaging scientist, storyteller, and curious mind.
This blog is my corner of the internet where I translate complex science into clear, relatable stories.

Whether it’s the inner workings of an MRI scanner, the promise of gene therapy, or the way tiny molecules shape human health, you’ll find it here — decoded, demystified, and made for everyone.

🔍 What you'll find:
Plain-language explainers on molecular imaging, MRI, gene therapy & more

Behind-the-scenes insights from the research bench

Stories at the intersection of science, tech, and humanity

🧠 Why this blog?
Because science isn’t just for scientists.
It’s for the dreamers, the learners, and the everyday explorers — like you.
Let’s decode it together.
